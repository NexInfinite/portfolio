# Portfolio 2023 Update
This was written in early 2023 and is currently under redvelopment. I am creating a new branch so that the older version can be kept for future usage. This was a really fun project and I loved the challenge of trying to everything work in only HTML/Javascript/CSS. I am going to be moving to nextjs to make future development easier (and maybe implement a future API?) and so this repo is going to undergo a lot of changes.

Thanks for reading <3
